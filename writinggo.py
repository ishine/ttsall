Â” Â”	I only used it once so far, but honestly so far, so good. It's really soft on my skin, and feels moisturizing. It makes my skin feel refreshed and hydrated after, and doesn't really have a scent!! I used lots of makeup wipes in the past- and Aveeno was my favorite (the no fragrance one). But THIS Neutrogena one is better than Aveeno!! It makes my skin feel better, and the wipes are a lot softer. My makeup comes off really easily, and it feels like a skin care wipe in a lot of ways. It doesn't feel like harsh chemicals or anything when I was taking off my mascara and eyeshadow. I saw Jenna Ortega advertise for them, and I had to try it LOL. Also the reviews were really good and it says "#1 best seller" on Amazon. I can see why! Only thing I would recommend is to make the wipes MORE hydrating. You can never get too much hydration! Also there is a slight scent, which smells good, but please make one with ZERO fragrance. Also on the Yuka app it says it has this Poly ingredient or something that's not super good for you (A LOT of makeup wipe brands have this ingredient), so please make ones without that! Lol. But yeah it gets all my makeup off pretty easily!
